            		<p>Through my design thinking approach and process, I sought to understand the needs of the target user, as well as, balance those needs with the company's objectives and technological capabilities.</p>
                <p>DISCOVER (Research): I began my research with interviews with a few employees and created a competitive analysis for like-businesses in the industry to gain a better understanding of what the trends that set the standard for the print management industry. In my research, it was also necessary to uncover the needs and frustrations of the target user to better uncover how to appeal to them. Lastly, I dove into the information architecture of the current site to evaluate the current status of the website</p>
                <p>DEFINE AND DESIGN (Ideate): Once I gained an understanding of the users desires and company requirements, I began the process by building out a new brand guideline reference packet (color palettes, typography, etc).</p>
                <p>I then dove into revamping the information architect to be more accessible for the new website, referencing my findings from research (breakdown of the initial website and user/task flows). I streamlined the menu options to make them straight-forward touch-points.</p>
                <p>Once I felt the website was organized in a way that is intuitive to the user, I began drawing out layout options in low-fidelity sketched wireframes, taking them to the computer only after I received feedback from a few stakeholders. I started to translate the low-fidelity wireframes into a high-fidelity website on Wordpress.</p>
                <p>As I put the website together, I had the company review the content of the website and provide me with updated content. This helped me decide if I needed to create a few graphical elements to complete the look and feel of the website.</p>
